      <description>Introduction Since the outbreak of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, it is now common knowledge that the Centers for Disease Control recommends that individuals frequently wash their hands for at least 20 seconds to protect against the virus and other pathogens. I’ve come to learn that 20 seconds feels a lot longer than you would imagine. The advice has been to sing the “Happy Birthday” or the ABC song twice, I’ve opted for the ABC song, but after a while it becomes an annoying affair.</description>

      <description>Introduction One of my goals this year was to build a robot for a Robot Riot event, affectionately known as Chicago’s worst and only robot fighting league. Initially, going into building it, I had no clue what the theme would be but after building the chassis, attaching the motors, and then deciding to use a PS3 controller as my control device for the robot, the idea eventually came to me. At first, I thought of making a Minecraft bot but then I saw a Minecraft built Tesla’s Cybertruck and thought why not the Cybertruck!</description>

      <description>Introduction Earlier this year, the Chicago Python Meetup Group held a workshop on CircuitPython. I entered an idea to build an activity monitor for the workshop and was selected to participate and received a Circuit Playground Express. The Circuit Playground Express offers a number of built-in sensors, an accelerometer, LEDs, and buttons. You can do a lot with just the microcontroller itself and I found it much easier to work with than the Arduino.</description>

      <description>Introduction I rarely have any issues with not having a car while living in the city. Except when winter rolls around. Waiting for the train to come in the cold is the worst part about the winter for me. For the last few weeks, I have found myself in the predicament where I leave the house and get to the train station only to find that the train is delayed or the next train is 15 minutes away.</description>
