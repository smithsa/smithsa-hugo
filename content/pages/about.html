<h2>Hey, I'm Sade Smith.</h2>

<p>I am an experienced Software Engineer with a degree in Computer Science from Carleton College who is currently working in the Chicagoland area. I specialize in web technologies and am skilled in both back-end and front-end development. As a polyglot programmer, I've worked with many languages; PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, Elm, Javascript, and Typescript, to name a few, and enjoy learning and using new languages.</p>

<p>Professionally, I've worked in agency settings as a web developer for over three years with a stint in the non-profit space and most recently transitioned into product engineering. I'm passionate about prototyping, problem-solving, and creating engaging, accessible, and resilient user experiences. My professional interests are primarily in software design, web performance, accessibility, and user experience.</p>

<p>As a versatile and pragmatic executionist, I believe I can solve most problems. With my critical thinking skills and creativity, I am confident in developing creative solutions to a wide range of problems. I am driven by my love of creating and the reality that I can contribute to the general welfare of society through my community.</p>

<p>Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, watching Women's Soccer, playing chess, flat ground skateboarding, playing basketball, golfing, reading, designing, playing guitar, gaming, and electronics! In general, I am curious about the world, so I am always learning something new.</p>
